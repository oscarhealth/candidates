# String Permuations

Given a string made of N unique characters, returns all the string permutations of length N

### Possible hints:

1. What are the permuatations for "ab"? What are the permutations for "abc"?
1. How do you construct the permutations for "abc" from "ab"? Candidate should see its recursive
1. How many permutations for "ab", "abc"? Candidate should see its factorial(n)
