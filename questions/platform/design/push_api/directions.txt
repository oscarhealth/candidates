Setup:
1) setup local database
   mysql> create database push_service
   sh> mysql -u root push_service < member.sql

2) build and run the api server
   sh> ./pants interview/platform/design/push_api:push_server
   sh> dist/push_server.pex

Task:

1) Create a table in mysql that can store data according to the schema in
clm_data.dat.

2) Write a parser to parse/validate the data in test_data/clm_data.dat

3) Store the parsed data in the mysql table create in step 1.

4) Notify push server with claim updates. Send a json post to localhost:8888
   containing two fields: installation_id and message. Message should be claim
   status and amount.

    The service will return a json object: {"ap_status_code": [1 | 2 | 3]}

    1: The push notification was sent to the device
    2: The device was not reachable
    3: The user has disabled push notifications for our application

    The push server will disable our account if it's sent too many messages to users who have disabled notifications

5) The push server will also tell you if a user has enabled or disabled push notifications

    /device_status

    POST: {"installation_id": <int>}

    returns: {"push_enabled": <true|false>}
