# Front End - Bug Squash
---
# NOT FOR CANDIDATE

---

# Summary

## requirements
### basic
- clicking toggle should open and close section
- styles should match the mock

### advanced (if time allows)
- clicking toggle should have accordian effect with group

## Timeline (45 min)
### setup 5 min
- Spend a few minutes making sure candidate understands goal, pointning out mocks as necessary

### squashing 35 min
- Focus on basic functionality first (open/close on click)
- If time allows, ask candidate to implement accordian behavior (click all others close)

### follow up questions 5 min
- if candidate didn't finish, ask what he/she would have done
- ask if there are any improvements candidate would make, even if they finished
- what tools/libs/frameworks would candidate use to build this site in production? What are their primary concerns?

## what you should look for
- Working knowledge of jquery / dom / events. If they don't know jquery that's ok, but they should know how to get it done
- Refactoring, or at least mentioning it, is important
- Candidate makes good use of dev/debugging tools
- Candidate clearly communicates thoughts and problem solving process
