# Notes for interviewer

## client side

- eval is evil
- code could use a lot more structure
- script tag in at the end
- simplify client side template (bonus points for getting it out of the dom)

## api v1

- returning an array is unsafe
- no way to paginate
- redundance in top articles
- bloat in related articles


## api v2

- might be too lean, will require api changes to get more content on page
